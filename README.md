# Picturely

Picturely is a social media app that allows users to share their photos
and connect with others around the world. It's designed as a clone of Instagram,
with similar features and functionality.

## Getting started and Installation:

While I'm coding this app I'm using docker containers so if you want to develop with docker
too and you have installed docker and docker-compose in your machine, you can just run the next
command and everything will be available for coding:

```sh
# for development environment
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml --build
```
